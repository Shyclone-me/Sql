# Campus Database Normalization & Docker Demonstration

A comprehensive laboratory demonstration of database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) using MySQL in Docker containers.  
This project simulates a real-world campus management system with a fully normalized database.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **Database Normalization**: Progressive transformation from unnormalized data to 3NF
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized MySQL database for reproducible testing
- **Real-world Application**: Campus management system simulation

---

## Learning Objectives

- Identify unnormalized data and anomalies
- Apply First, Second, and Third Normal Forms
- Implement normalized schemas using SQL
- Simulate real-world database behavior
- Understand normalization as a data consistency and security mechanism

---

## Features

- **Complete Normalization Process**: Step-by-step transformation from unnormalized to 3NF
- **Docker Containerization**: Easy setup and deployment
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple verification queries
- **Detailed Documentation**: Lab manual included
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Campus database simulation

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/university-normalization-docker.git
cd university-normalization-docker
Start MySQL Docker Container

docker-compose up -d


Connect to MySQL

docker exec -it university_db mysql -u root -p


Password: root

Run Verification Query

SOURCE /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/03_verify.sql;


Expected Output
You will see the fully normalized university table reconstructed.

Database Schema
Unnormalized Form (Initial)
UNIVERSITY_DATA
(StudentID, Name, Email, Major, Advisor, CourseID, CourseTitle, Credits, Grade, Building, Room)

First Normal Form (1NF)

Atomic values only

No multi-valued attributes

Second Normal Form (2NF)

Tables:

STUDENTS (StudentID, Name, Email, Major)

COURSES (CourseID, CourseTitle, Credits, Building, Room)

ENROLLMENTS (StudentID, CourseID, Grade)

Third Normal Form (3NF)

Tables:

MAJORS (Major, Advisor)

STUDENTS (StudentID, Name, Email, Major)

COURSES (CourseID, CourseTitle, Credits, Building, Room)

ENROLLMENTS (StudentID, CourseID, Grade)

Verification

Query: Joins all tables to reconstruct the original dataset

SELECT
    s.StudentID,
    s.Name,
    s.Email,
    s.Major,
    m.Advisor,
    c.CourseID,
    c.CourseTitle,
    c.Credits,
    e.Grade,
    c.Building,
    c.Room
FROM Students s
JOIN Majors m ON s.Major = m.Major
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
JOIN Courses c ON e.CourseID = c.CourseID;


Expected Output: Matches original dataset with no redundancy

Troubleshooting

Port Already in Use

docker-compose down
# or change host port in docker-compose.yml


Container Already Exists

docker rm -f university_db


MySQL Not Ready

Wait a few seconds for initialization

Then connect and run queries
